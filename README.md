He is the one who told us about having the new perspective of life . He focused on showing and promoting unique ways about handling this new journey with utter sense of responsibilty .
 * First and the formost thought he shared is about "Change". A Good Change resluts in awesome outcomes. Changes are a natural and a major part of life .
